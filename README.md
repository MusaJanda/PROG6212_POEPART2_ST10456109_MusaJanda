## Overview üöÄ

CMCS is a web-based application designed to streamline the process of submitting and approving monthly claims for contract lecturers. The system replaces a manual, paper-based workflow with a digital solution, improving efficiency and providing a clear audit trail.

This project was developed using **ASP.NET Core MVC** with **Entity Framework Core** and **ASP.NET Identity** for user management and role-based authorization.
